Perfect 👍 I’ll reformat your High-Level Design (HLD) into a **well-structured, professional, and presentation-ready format** just like I did for the LLD.

# 📌 Trello Clone – High-Level Design (HLD)

## 1. Architecture Overview

### 🔹 Frontend

* Built with **Next.js (React)**, using **App Router**.
* Communicates with backend via **RESTful API endpoints**.
* Handles **authentication, board/list/card UI, drag-and-drop**.

### 🔹 Backend

* **Next.js API Routes** handle server-side logic.
* Uses **Supabase (Postgres)** as the primary database.
* **Prisma ORM** for schema definition & migrations.
* **JWT-based authentication** secures protected endpoints.

### 🔹 Database

* Hosted on **Supabase (Postgres)**.
* Implements **Row Level Security (RLS)** for strict data privacy.

---

## 2. Major Modules

### 2.1. Authentication Module

**Features:**

* User registration & login.
* Password hashing (**bcrypt**).
* JWT issuance & validation.

**Flow:**

1. User submits credentials.
2. Backend validates credentials.
3. Issues JWT for subsequent API requests.

---

### 2.2. Board Management Module

**Features:**

* Create, view, update, delete boards.
* Boards are grouped under organizations.

**Flow:**

1. User creates a board.
2. Board is linked to an organization & user.

---

### 2.3. List & Card Management Module

**Features:**

* CRUD operations for lists & cards.
* **Drag-and-drop** movement between lists.
* Positioning managed for ordering.

**Flow:**

1. User adds/edits/moves lists or cards.
2. API updates DB & returns new state.

---

### 2.4. Organization & Membership Module

**Features:**

* Each user gets a personal organization.
* Supports multiple users per organization (**future extensibility**).

**Flow:**

1. On registration, system creates an organization.
2. Boards are linked to organizations.

---

### 2.5. Label, Comment, and Activity Module (Extensible)

**Features:**

* Cards support labels, assignees, comments, and activity logs.

**Flow:**

1. User interacts with card (add label, comment, etc.).
2. API updates relevant tables.

---

## 3. Data Flow

* **User Authentication**
  User logs in → API validates → Issues JWT → JWT stored in localStorage.

* **Fetching Boards**
  Frontend calls `/api/boards` with JWT → Backend validates → Returns user’s boards.

* **Board View**
  Frontend calls `/api/boards/[id]` → Returns lists & cards for that board.

* **Drag-and-Drop**
  User drags a card → Frontend updates UI & sends position to API → API updates DB.

---

## 4. Security

* **JWT Authentication** → Required for all protected endpoints.
* **Row Level Security (RLS)** → Enforced in DB to ensure user-specific access.
* **Password Hashing** → Passwords never stored in plain text.

---

## 5. Scalability & Extensibility

* **Modular API** → Each entity (board, list, card, etc.) has its own route.
* **Database Schema** → Supports future features (labels, comments, team collab).
* **Frontend** → Component-based, easy to extend.

---

## 6. Deployment & Environment

* **Frontend & Backend** → Deployed as single Next.js app (Vercel/Netlify).
* **Database** → Hosted on **Supabase**.
* **Environment Variables** → Used for JWT secret, Supabase keys, etc.

---

## 7. Third-Party Integrations

* **Supabase** → Database hosting, authentication, RLS.
* **Prisma** → Schema definition & migrations.
* **@dnd-kit** → Drag-and-drop functionality.
